** **
** This program was prepared as part of the requirements for IT 2789, Structured Programming. **
** **
** COURSE DESCRIPTION: **
** This is the second of a three course programming sequence. IT 2789, Structured Programming, builds on the **
** concepts learned in IT 2100, Programming Logic. Programming Logic introduces programming concepts without **
** any coding syntax. **
** **
** Structured Programming expands the student’s knowledge of programming concepts in the context of a **
** programming language and its integrated development environment. It expands the student’s knowledge of **
** algorithm design while introducing structured/modular programming in the context of a programming language. **
** It explores implementing the basic programming concepts of variables (primitive and abstract), data types, strings, **
** arithmetic and logical operators, decisions, and loops. **
** **
** In this course the student begin implementing algorithms. Students learn to develop applications in ways that **
** facilitate program maintenance by producing self-documenting code as well as using program comments properly. **
** **
** In addition, this course continues to develop basic problem solving analysis and critical thinking skills that aid the **
** student when developing algorithms. **
** **
** This course does not include Object Oriented Programming, which is included in the next course in the sequence. **
** **
** This course does not include the use of Graphical User Interfaces, which is included in the next course in the **
** sequence. **
